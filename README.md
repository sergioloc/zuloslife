> Software engineering thesis

> 2019/2020

This is a project about developing a 2D platform videogame in Unity. Where we can 
see the different phases of its creation: game history, characters design, animations 
system, necessary scripts, musical composition, etc.

It is a videogame where each level has a different gameplay, so it could be considered 
as several games in one. In these levels we find various characters and scenarios, 
which are inspired by elements from the real world.
